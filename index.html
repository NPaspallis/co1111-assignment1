    <h1>Sample Treasure Hunt app</h1>
    <div>
        This is a sample project for CO1111's assignment, aka the Treasure Hunt app.
        It describes the minimum content you need to have in your app.
    </div>
    <div>
        <button onclick="location.href='app.html';">Find the Treasure Hunt!</button>
    </div>
    <div>
        As this is the 'index' page, it will be the landing point for everyone visiting your team's page.
    </div>
    <div>
        Note some important requirements:
        <ul>
            <li>This is the landing page. Make sure it looks good and explains clearly the purpose of this page.</li>
            <li>One of the main purposes of this landing page is to <i>market</i> your app. So use what you have learned in class to explain your advantages (make it wort-while for your visitors).</li>
            <li>The recommendation is to keep all your marketing/video/info details in a single page but it's ok if you decide to split that to multiple pages.</li>
            <li>Make an effort to use best practice approaches, splitting the content (HTML) and design properties (CSS) to separate files.</li>
            <li>Your page and app should have a 'mobile-first' design, meaning it should certainly be functional and appropriate for mobile devices. But also test it on desktop screens. If you properly use RWD principles the page should automatically adjust as needed.</li>
            <li>You are encouraged to <u>not use</u> any of the styling frameworks (such as Bootstrap or Material etc.). I know they are good, but it's better if you try try to build your own web-app from scratch for scratch, so you get the right experience.</li>
            <li>Make sure to add a clearly visible link such as a button to allow opening your <i>web-app</i> page, as shown above.</li>
            <li>Please keep all your JavaScript in a single file, e.g. named <code>th-api.js</code>. Follow the instructions in the handout for defining the right functions.</li>
            <li>There is also a requirement to specify a <a href="test.html">test.html</a> page that includes your testing scripts.</li>
            <li>Please note this project is only a reference. You are not required to clone it or use it as the starting point (but feel free to do so if you wish). Your definite guide is the assignment handout itself though.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        Make sure to include a list of all team members at the end. It's suggested to use alphabetic order, e.g.:
